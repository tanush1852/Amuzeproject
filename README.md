Current music streaming platforms often fall short in delivering truly personalized recommendations, relying on algorithms that may not adequately capture individual preferences. This results in a less engaging and tailored music discovery experience, limiting the potential for users to explore new and exciting songs that align with their unique tastes.
 To address this problem, our project aims to develop a web-based platform that utilizes a option-based interface, allowing users to indicate their musical preferences by creating a tracklist containing their personal favourites. The platform will not only recommend songs based on these preferences but also actively seek and incorporate user feedback, enhancing the overall user experience and providing a more tailored music recommendation service.
